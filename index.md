## Welcome to my personal webpage

I am a Lecturer in the Department of Civil Engineering and Industrial Design in University of Liverpool, since Sep 2018. Before this, I worked as a Research Fellow in the Institute for Transport Studies at University of Leeds (2015-2018) and a Research Associate at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (2014-2015). I hold a PhD in Civil Engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (2014) and a BEng in Automation from University of Science and Technology of China (2009).

I have a broad spectrum of research interest in transport-related problems, with an aim to improve the system efficiency and sustainability to benefit both the travellers and the operators. In particular, I have combined quantitative modelling and analytical skills (such as optimisation, control theory and econometrics) extensively with transportation theories in the modelling and analysis of rail and road systems as well as their operation, management and control.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
