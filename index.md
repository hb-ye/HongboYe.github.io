Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

I have a broad spectrum of research interest in transport-related problems, with an aim to improve the system efficiency and sustainability to benefit both the travellers and the operators.  I have utilized optimisation and control theory in the modelling and analysis of rail and road systems as well as their operation, management and control.

I am welcoming visiting students/scholars and PhD applications in the areas which fits my research interest and expertise. Please drop me an email if you are interested.
